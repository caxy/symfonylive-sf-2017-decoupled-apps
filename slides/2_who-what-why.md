# DECOUPLED APPS

///

## WHAT IS A DECOUPLED APPLICATION?

In the context of this talk: 

**An application which has its front-end decoupled from its back-end,<br/> where the front-end interfaces with a back-end API**

---

## WHY DECOUPLED APPS MATTER

Decoupled applications and single-page applications (SPAs)<br/> are becoming widely-used, **and for good reason**.

///

### Advantages of Decoupling front-end & back-end

- Ability to build the Front-end as a SPA
- Better performance & scalability
- Develop faster
- Improved deployments & infrastructure
- Additional abstraction layer

///

#### Single-Page Applications (SPAs)

- Ability to deliver a greatly improved user experience
- Better performance
    - smaller request load
    - less server-side load
    - code splitting
- Advanced front-end tooling

///

#### Better performance & scalability

- Front-end as static deploy can scale out of box
- Back-end scaling easier
- Back-end can use HTTP caching for API resources

///

#### Develop faster

- Front-end and back-end can work independently with a well-defined API interface
- Front-end developers work in familiar code and environment
- Back-end developers work in familiar code and environment
- Allows for rapid prototyping without writing code that will ultimately be scrapped

///

#### Deployments & Infrastructure

- Can have separate deploy pipelines
- Front-end deployed as static application
- More granular versioning 

///

#### Additional abstraction layer

- Front-end and back-end code completely separated
- Can have different conventions and standards
- Release front-end from the structures and opinions of the back-end
